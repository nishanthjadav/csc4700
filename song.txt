Better in the Dark

[Verse 1]
When I saw you standing there
With the dyed-up blonded hair
They said that you had clout
I said I didn't care
When the liquor was all clear
I could see you through the glass
There's something I could tell you
But I forgot to ask

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the stars
The lighter makes a spark
But I look better in the dark
I look better in the dark

[Verse 2]
Do you think it would be weird
If I dropped into a dream?
Always the first to know
Always the last to leave
If you're sober in the morning
We can always just pretend
That you're drunk on the way home
And the party didn't end

[Chorus]
When the sunlight meets the dawn
You'll see I'm not the one you want
'Cause I look better in the dark

[Outro]
The night is a thief some poet once wrote
That steals the colors from the day
It's kind of pretty if you like words but
They're not exactly true
Because there are colors at night
The burning red of passion
The angry green of jealousy and
The ugly, terrifying black of fear
